We use the following tools:

* Redpanda - In charge of all the streams.
* Quix - Detects flight delay events and triggers customer notifications
* Apache Pinot - Finds customers affected by delays and finds flights for impacted customers.
* OpenAI - Generate the notification messages sent to customers
